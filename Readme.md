ShapeIt

This software allows extracting the gamma-ray strength function for a given nucleus, based on a 2D matrix of gamma-ray energy vs excitation energy. The matrix is assumed to be in units of keV.

To run ShapeIt, change to ShapeIt1.0/Source and say "root ShapeIt.C"

Currently, ShapeIt is only tested using root 6.16.00 under Mac Os 10.14 (Mojave). ShapeIt seems NOT to run under Root5.
