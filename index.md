## Welcome to _ShapeIt_.

_ShapeIt_ is a software developed to analyze gamma-ray strength functions and level densities for atomic nuclei using the so called _Shape Method_. 

To run _ShapeIt_ you need to install the freely available [ROOT](https://root.cern) framework developed at [CERN](https://cern.ch). _ShapeIt_ is only tested using root version 6 under Mac Os 10.14 (Mojave).

## Installation
You first need to install ROOT version 6, see above. For using _ShapeIt_ is is sufficient (and much easier!) to install ROOT using the available precompiled binaries for MacOS, Linux or Windows.  

To install _ShapeIt_, clone or download the [_ShapeIt_ github repository](https://github.com/dennismuecher/ShapeIt). 

Now open a terminal and change into the _Source_ directory of your ShapeIt directory. Here, simply type `root ShapeIt.C` That's it! Easy, eh?
